### Hello world
Languages: C, (now learning C++ and x86 asm)

My project wishlist:
* Hobby os (bootloader included)
* Text editor
* An interpreted language
* Terminal emulator (linux)
* A platformer game
* A JSON parser
* Learn some socket stuff

```c
#include "projects.h"
int main()
{
    return project_realisation();
}
```
